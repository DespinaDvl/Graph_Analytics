# Graph_Analytics
In this assignment, Dijkstraâ€™s Shortest Path Algorithm is implemented and applied to solve several problems. A program, which is used for directed weighted graphs with positive arc weighs, is designed in Python. With this program, problems related to shortest path spanning tree in a graph for a root node to all other nodes are studied.
