1. algorithms.py - This is the main code file which contains all the Minimum Spanning Tree, Heap implementation, centrality and betweenness code. There is a test graph file with the name test.weighted.edgelist which you can give as an input to the program. 

2. random_graph_generator.py - This is a random graph generator program which allows the generation of random graphs using the prefrential attachment method. 

3. for_testing_aor.py - This program is a modified version that was used to test the runtime of the program.
